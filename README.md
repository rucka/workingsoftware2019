# [WorkingSoftware](https://www.agilemovement.it/workingsoftware/) 2019

Here both the slides and demos of my session "Typescript come (forse) non lo hai mai visto".

## System requirements

In order to run the demos you need an editor (Visual Studio Code in my case) and node v11.8.0:

Install all dependencies locally running the command .`/yarn.sh` script.

To run the demo and serve the html page (http://localhost:8080). please exec `npm run start`.

## Demos

- 1 - OOP Validation: it shows how to implement the register customer validation demo in OOP way using class ES6 feature.
- 2 - Functional validation: it shows how to implement the register customer demo in a Functional Programming way using Generics, Union type and Discriminated unions Typescript features.
- 3 - Functional validation with fp-ts: the same demo but implemented using the library [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts).
